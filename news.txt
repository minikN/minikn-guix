         (en "This is a personal channel that is meant as a staging ground
for changes I plan on making upstream to guix, however there may be packages
that may never be contributed due to technical or ideological reasons.
This channel can now take advantage of the new support for
authenticated updates in @command{guix pull}, which protects you from attempts
to tamper with this repository and ship malicious code instead.
To ensure you only receive genuine updates from rekahsoft-guix, you should update your
@file{~/.config/guix/channels.scm} to include the channel introduction:
